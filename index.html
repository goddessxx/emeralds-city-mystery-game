        Emerald City is full of wealthy faires. This city is known for its
        drunken nights and partying till 7am! Though this city is rich, crime is
        still present, and it is not the safest city to live in. Criminals run
        Emerald City, and through scamming and banking heists they made
        millions. The night of one of their bank heists, a janitor was there,
        working late. She ended up being shot that night because she was a
        witness of the robbery. Her name was Anna May, she was loved by many in
        emerald city. So, when the town heard she was shot during the heist, the
        town would stop at nothing to find the criminals that murdered Anna in
        cold blood.
