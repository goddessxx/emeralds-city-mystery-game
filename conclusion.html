        the two humans were spotted in an alley high on fairy dust. You called
        the police and they arrived and arrested them. The police were finally
        able to confirm this arrest when the security footage came back and
        showed the two humans robbing the bank. <br />
        Officer: 'Thank you so much for catching these two scums. Emerald city
        will forever be in your debt.'
